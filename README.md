> [!WARNING]
> This is a **custom fork** of [ox_inventory](https://github.com/communityox/ox_inventory) — do not update from upstream without reviewing bridge compatibility.

> [!NOTE]
> **Working end-to-end:** Items, weapons, shops, stashes, trunks/gloveboxes, drops, crafting benches (ped spawn + targeting + open), cash sync (bidirectional with mythic-finance), character lifecycle, job group restrictions, item metadata (staticMetadata + type-based auto-generation), starter items with character data.
>
> **Pending:** Crafting UI (ox slot grid works but needs mythic-style panel), schematics per-player unlock + DB storage, item use progress bars, notifications via mythic-notify.

## 📖 Overview

A fork of [ox_inventory](https://github.com/communityox/ox_inventory) with a full Mythic Framework compatibility bridge. Other mythic resources — drugs, police, robbery, targeting, finance, admin — require zero code changes. Item definitions, shops, stashes, trunks, gloveboxes, drops, and crafting benches are all handled transparently through the bridge.

Item definitions and crafting configs are **bundled directly** into this resource under `data/mythic-items/` and `data/mythic-crafting/`. `mythic-inventory` does not need to be running.

---

## 🔗 Mythic Bridge

The bridge lives in `modules/bridge/mythic/` and is loaded automatically when `inventory:framework` is set to `mythic`.

**What's bridged:**

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| `FetchComponent('Inventory')` — all shims | ✅ |
| `Inventory.Items` — RegisterUse, Remove, Has, HasAnyItems | ✅ |
| Item database — all mythic item files converted at startup | ✅ |
| Item metadata — `staticMetadata`, type-based auto-generation, govid char data | ✅ |
| Shops — bundled from mythic-inventory config, location + programmatic | ✅ |
| Stashes, trunks, gloveboxes, drops | ✅ |
| Character spawn / logout / job update | ✅ |
| Finance sync (cash item ↔ mythic-finance, bidirectional) | ✅ |
| State bag sync (ItemStates, isCuffed, isDead) | ✅ |
| `FetchComponent('Crafting')` — RegisterBench, full bench pipeline | ✅ |
| Crafting bench ped/model/zone spawning (client) | ✅ |
| Crafting bench open (targeting → ox crafting UI) | ✅ |
| Crafting UI — mythic-style panel | ✅ |
| Schematics — per-player unlock + DB storage | ⏳ Planned |
| Item use — emotes + progress bar via mythic Progress component | ✅ |
| Notifications via mythic-notify | ⏳ Planned |

**Required in `server.cfg`:**
```
set inventory:framework "mythic"
```

## ⏳ Pending

### Crafting UI
The current crafting UI is ox's default — a slot grid where hovering a slot shows ingredients. A mythic-style panel (recipe list left, detail + ingredients + craft button right, search, craftable filter) is planned using Mantine once installed.

### Schematics
Schematic recipes are registered as a `crafting-schematics` bench at startup. What's missing is per-player unlock storage (ox MySQL, keyed on player SID + bench ID), a schematic item use handler to trigger the unlock, and merging unlocked schematics into the bench on open. See `modules/bridge/mythic/crafting_server.lua`.

### Notifications
Item add/remove notifications use ox's built-in notify. Should route through `mythic-notify` to match the server's notification style. See `modules/bridge/mythic/client.lua` → `Inventory:Client:Changed` handler.
